// This is a freeform web scraping project. You will use request and cheerio to scrape a web site for information. Some ideas:
//
// Get information about countries, plants, animals from Wikipedia.
// Get information about programming languages from Wikipedia.
// Get information about Pokemon from...somewhere on the internet.
// The end result of your project is a publish npm module, with which people can get information for a given thing or topic. For example, maybe they can get information about any programming language with this code:
//
// var programmingLanguages = require('programming-languages');
// programmingLanguages.getInfo('JavaScript', function(err, info) {
//   console.log(info); // And info will be an object containing various
//                      // info on JavaScript on Wikipedia
// });
// You will design the API (application programming interface) - which is just a fancy word for how people will use your module. You will write a README file for your module, which will teach them how to use it.
